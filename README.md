# MockGiphyPlugin
This is a mock project for a giphy plugin. 

This project is supposed to simulate a plugin button that would be placed within wordpress editor.

TO DO:
- Get the copyToClipboard() function working, probably by pulling in clipboard.js (https://clipboardjs.com/)
- Fold this funcionality into a wordpress plugin by following the wordpress docs closely: https://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin
